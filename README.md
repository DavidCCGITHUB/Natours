## Overview

This project was meant to practice the HTML and CSS skills and features, allowing me to understand how to accomplish different animations and features that professional webpages have.
The project is a homepage example with different sections based on a tour through nature and booking cabins, built on SASS with no Javascript, meant only for aesthetics and visual effects only.
